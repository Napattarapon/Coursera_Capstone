## 1.Introduction
Our main goal is to building a machine learning model for predicting condo price in Sao Paulo to help real state investors to make better business decisions.

### Objectives:
Identify the most expensive neighborhoods through data analysis and visualization tools.
Build a simple regression model for predicting land prices in Sao Paulo.
Improve prediction model by adding data through the Foursquare API.

## 2.Description of the data
The main data used for this project will be from two sources:

The rent/sale condo price in Sao Paulo. (Kaggle)
The venues in each neighborhood. (FourSquare API)
Link to kaggle Dataset

### Using data to solve the question:
First, correlation between sale price and all factors will be checked.
Second, if correlated, machine learning techniques (PCA, Regression, PCR) will be used to analyze the data.
